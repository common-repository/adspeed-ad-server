This plugin displays ads from your AdSpeed account on the sidebar or within a post. Ads are served, managed and tracked for impressions and clicks by AdSpeed AdServer. You setup and manage ads inside your AdSpeed account.

== Description ==

AdSpeed.com is a hosted ad server and ad manager. You enter your ads and targeting criteria into AdSpeed. We serve ads, track and report real-time statistics about ad impressions, clicks, revenue, and conversions. You manage your ad inventory through our online user-friendly interface.

Ads on the Sidebar
------------------
Navigate to "Appearance > Widgets". Click on a specific Widget Area you would like to edit. Select the + prompt to add a block. Search for  "AdSpeed Ad Server". For each block (ad placement), you need to specify a zone identification number. This zone ID must exist within your AdSpeed account and do NOT enter the zone name. You can find the zone ID under the first column of the zone list in your AdSpeed account.

Ads in a Blog Entry
-------------------
To use it in a post, write this macro "{AdSpeed:Zone:1234}" to display an ad from zone #1234. In this example, "1234" is a zone identification number in your AdSpeed account. Do NOT enter the zone name. This macro will be replaced with the actual ad tag for the zone in your post. You can find the zone ID under the first column of the zone list in your AdSpeed account.

Styling Ad Block
-------------------
Each ad placement is enclosed within a DIV container with CSS class "AdSpeedWP" so you can change/customize ad styles like color, border, spacing, margin, alignment, etc.
